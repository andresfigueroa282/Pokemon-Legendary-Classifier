    "While 'height_m' and 'weight_kg' are numerical features, I will probably drop the following features because pokemon, even legendary, can range from big to small and I believe that height and weight have no bearing on whether a pokemon is legendary or not. I believe the same with types, a legendary pokemon can have almost any typing, so I will probably drop type1 and type2. 'percentage_male' is interesting because I remembered that there are genderless pokemon which explains the missing values. Still I believe gender doesn't play a role in determining whether a pokemon is legendary or not. As I remove these features, I simplifying the dataset and avoiding unnecessary noise. "
